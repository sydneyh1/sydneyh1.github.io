            <h1>Granny's Bed and Breakfast</h1>
            <p> Granny's Bed and Breakfast is a family owned and operated business. Located
              on main street and within walking distance to the famous clock tower,
              this cozy little cottage-style inn has accomodations fit for young
            and old. There are also specialty rooms, such as the room where Emma Swan
            stayed when she came to town, or the room where Pinocio did his work
            on Henry's book. Granny and her granddaughter Ruby single-handedly
            dominate the hotel industry in Storybrooke so if you're looking for a place to stay, Granny's your gal! </p>
            <p> Amenities include: </p>
            <li> Linens, sheets, blankets, towels </li>
            <li> Heating and Air Conditioning </li>
            <li> Washer and Dryer </li>
            <li> High-speed wifi </li>
            <li> Complimentary breakfast at Granny's Diner! </li>
            <p> Don't wait another minute to reserve your room! </p>
                <h1>Granny's Diner</h1>
            <p> It just so happens that Granny and Ruby also control the food
            and beverage industry in town. Their diner is in the same building as
          their lodging accomodations and almost all locals are regulars. A lunch
          at Granny's is a sure way to meet some of your favorite fairytales. Maybe
          even get the chance to talk over a mug of Granny's famous hot chocolate.
         </p>
