            <h1>The History of Storybrooke</h1>
<p> On the night of the birth of Snow White's daughter, the evil queen cast a
            spell upon the entire land. All of the fairytale creatures you grew up
              reading about were transported to this world, stripped of their
              magic and memory. The Queen made this happen so that Snow White would
              not be able to live happily with her true love, Prince James. When the
              curse was cast, Snow White and James put their newborn baby, Emma, into an
              enchanted tree trunk, transporting her to this world ahead of thier family and friends.

<p> 28 years later, Emma returned to Storybrooke and broke part of the curse - her family and
  friends regained their memory and their magic but they remain here, walking among
  us. </p>
  <p> Since then, the citizens of Storybrooke have decided to open thier town up
    to visitors - normal people like you and me. Now, anyone has the ability to
    travel to Storybrooke and see what it would be like to live with magical powers.
    Storybrooke offers a glimpse into a world where Evil Queens reign, princes embark
    on dangerous quests for their princesses, and true love conquers all...
