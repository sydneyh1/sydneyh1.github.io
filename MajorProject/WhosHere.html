            <h1>Who Will You Meet?</h1>
            <p> Any fairytale that you could imagine live in Storybrooke but listed
            below are just a few of the highlights... </p>

            <h1>Snow White and Prince Charming</h1>
            <p> Snow White and her husband live with their daughter, Emma, and grandson
            Henry in the heart of town. If something important is happening in
          STorybrooke (which is always the case) you're sure to see all for of them there. </p>
            <h1>Rumplestiltskin and Belle</h1>
            <p> Rumplestiltskin, notorious for his deals and wealh, lives with
            his girlfriend, Belle above his/Mr. Gold's shop. Be aware of this
          trickster and the contracts he may get you to sign, but, if Belle is
        by his side, he should remain fairly calm and civilized. </p>
            <h1>The Evil Queen</h1>
            <p> The Queen is the self-proclaimed mayor of Storybrooke and, as such, she
            lives in the mayor's mansion. You can't miss it or the apple trees that
          she has growing out front... </p>
